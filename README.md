This is a class project in the 5th week of the codaisseur program. The basics are setuo by teacher Wouter de Vos. In teams we worked on the back end (ruby on rails) and front end (React). This repo is the React part. I worked on a header and footer which are not yet added. I plan to add this and hope my other classmates are enthousiastic about the idea of working on this further to finish te game!


The below is readme is from the original repo.
